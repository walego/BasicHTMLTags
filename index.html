        <p>One time there was the unbelievable story of a man who could jump so incredibly high that he was the world's greatest window washer. The unbelievable part is how he would blatantly disregard basic ladder safety by skipping rungs and not maintaining at least 3 points of contact. Someone needs to tell him that 3 feet isn't really all that high.</p>
